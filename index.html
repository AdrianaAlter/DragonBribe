        Your mission is to appease the local dragon by collecting jewels as tribute.  Catch the jewels by using your left and right arrow keys to move the basket.  But be careful!  You must catch at least 50 jewels before the timer runs out, or the dragon will eat you.

    <div id="game-won">
      <h1>Good job!</h1>
      <p>
        You collected enough jewels to convince the dragon that you are of more use to him alive than dead!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, dragons are not known for being rational or predictable, so this does not actually guarantee your safety.  You should probably consider moving to somewhere without a dragon.

      <h1>Oh no!</h1>
      <p>
        You failed to collect enough jewels.  The dragon is not impressed, and has eaten you.  Better luck next time!
